    "Conceptually, you can represent a 3D grid by just displaying grid points. However, this type of representation is not ideal in sens of visualizaion: for instance, the spacing between your points allows you to see points behind those your are observing and so perturbates your comprehension of what you are observing. The other solution is to represent the surface of your grid by interpolating data between two adjacent points. An easy tool able to do this very efficiently is the software Paraview. **pypStag** "
